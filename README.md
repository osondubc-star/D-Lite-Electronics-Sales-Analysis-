**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Comprehensive analysis of 6 months (January - June 2025) of sales data for D-Lite Electronics, a Nigerian electronics retailer operating across 4 regions (North, South, East, West). 
This project identifies critical business risks and provides data-driven recommendations for revenue growth and risk mitigation.


**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**  

D-Lite Electronics is a mid-sized Nigerian electronics retailer with ₦302.7M in semi-annual revenue, serving both B2B and retail customers across multiple regions.

**KEY METRICS**
- **Total Revenue:** ₦302.7 Million
- **Total Units Sold:** 1,141 units
- **Analysis Period:** January - June 2025

- **Regions Analyzed:** 4 (North, South, East, West)

- **Product Categories:** Multiple electronics including laptops, smartphones, accessories

- **Sales Team Size:** 5 representatives

- **Customer Base:** Mix of B2B wholesalers and retail customers


**KEY FINDINGS**
1. REGIONAL PERFORMANCE DISPARITY

**Findings:** Significant revenue concentration in West region with North region critically underperforming.

**DATA:**
- **West Region:** ₦115.5M (38% of total revenue) - Top performer
- **East Region:** ₦79.5M (26%)
- **South Region:** ₦68.1M (23%)
- **North Region:** ₦39.5M (13%) -

**Critical Underperformance**

**Business Impact:** North region represents ₦76M revenue gap compared to West region despite similar market presence and infrastructure investment.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

2. PRODUCT CONCENTRATION RISK

**Finding:** Dangerous dependency on single product line (Laptop A15) for nearly half of total revenue.

**DATA:**
- **Laptop A15:** ₦134M (44% of total revenue)
- Next highest product: <15% of revenue
- Product portfolio: 10+ SKUs

**Business Risk:** If Laptop A15 faces supply chain disruption, competitive pressure, or demand decline, business could lose 44% of revenue overnight.

**Strategic Implication:**  Urgent need for product diversification to reduce business vulnerability.

3. CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION RISK

**Finding:** Over-reliance on small number of large customers creates significant revenue vulnerability.
**Data:**
- **Top 5 customers:** 67% of total revenue
- **Omega Wholesale (largest customer):** ₦91M (30% of revenue)
- **Customer base:** 50+ active customers
**Business Risk:** Loss of Omega Wholesale alone would eliminate 30% of revenue. Loss of top 5 customers would be catastrophic.
**Strategic Implication:** Urgent customer diversification required to mitigate dependency risk.

4. SALES REPRESENTATIVE PERFORMANCE GAP

**Finding:** Extreme variation in individual sales rep performance indicates training opportunity or resource misallocation.

**DATA:**
- **Peter Obi (Top performer):** ₦87.8M (29% of total sales)

- **Lowest performer:** ~₦35M

- **Performance gap:** 2.5x between top and bottom performers

**Business Opportunity:** If bottom performers could reach 75% of Peter Obi's performance, business could generate additional ₦20-25M in revenue with existing resources.

**Recommended Action**
Identify Peter Obi's successful strategies and replicate across team through training and mentorship.

5. SEVERE REVENUE VOLATILITY

**Finding:** Unexplained extreme month-to-month revenue fluctuations indicating potential operational or market ISSUES.

**DATA:**
- **Highest month (February):** ₦124.3M
- **Lowest month (March):** ₦18.9M
- **Month-over-month drop:** 85% (Feb to March)
- **Average monthly revenue:** ₦50.4M

**Business Concern:**  March revenue crash requires immediate investigation.

Possible causes:
- Major customer order timing
- Seasonal effect

- Competitive pressure
- Internal operational issue

**Strategic Implication:** Need for revenue forecasting system and contingency planning to manage volatility.
